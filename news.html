									<h3>September 2022</h3>
									
									<br>
									
									<p>The last few months have seen a few big acheivements for JITSUVAX. Firstly the development of both the full and short-form Pro-VH-Be questionnaire have been published. This questionnaire will now be used to measure the outcomes of experiments carried out as we work towards the development of the novel empathic refutational interview technique that is the major aim of JITSUVAX. 
									<br>
									</p>

									<p>We have also produced a website which allows healthcare professionals and others to search for information to refute arguments against vaccination. The psychological traits or ‘attitude roots’ which underlie these arguments are described, based on the Taxonomy that has been developed by the JITSUVAX team. The website is informative and can be used on it’s own but longer-term is intended to as a look-up tool alongside the empathic refutational interview.

									<p><h3>March 2022</h3>
									
									<br>
									
									<p>JITSUVAX research got off to a flying start after a few months of planning and preparation. We’ve got a lot interest in our research from media, local authorities, and educational institutions across the EU and UK, and members of the team are frequently appearing on TV, radio and in newspapers and online magazines. Below is a brief summary of progress so for.</p>
									
									<br>
									
									<p><strong>Work Package 1: Developing a survey</strong>
									<br>
									The first aim of WP1 is to create a validated survey to measure vaccine confidence among Health Care Professionals (HCP’s). This survey can then be used to assess HCP attitudes about vaccinations in the five JITSUVAX countries. This work is led by the Finnish and French teams who have done a great job in drawing all of the teams together on this joint effort.
									<br>
									The work to create the first version of this survey in French came from a collaboration between researchers in France, Canada, and Belgium. The JITSUVAX team have developed, translated and adapted to so that now there are country-specific versions for Finland (in two languages), France, Germany, Portugal and the UK.
									<br>
									The information from the pilot survey which has been run in each country has shown that the survey is reliable. Over the next two months the full survey will be running with at least 500 HCP’s in each country taking part.
									<br>
									The first analysis from the pilot studies has given us more understanding about which anti-vaccination arguments are the most challenging for HCPs to counter. This information from each country has been used to develop the final form of the survey, which is going live between March and April 2022.
									<br>
									The data from the full survey will give us a good understanding of how HCP’s who work with vaccines feel about vaccination. We will be able to look at information from the individual countries and see how they compare, as well as analysing the data as a whole.
									</p>
									
									<br>
									
									<p><strong>Work Package 2: Analysis of anti-vaccination arguments</strong>
									<br>
									The teams in Bristol, Coimbra and Erfurt Universities worked together to collect all of the arguments against vaccination that they could find. These have been grouped and classified into a ‘taxonomy’ which will be published after peer review. The different groups of arguments have been linked to their underlying roots, the psychological factors that contribute to vaccine hesitancy. These roots include such things as a tendency to believe in conspiracy theories or a belief that diseases are not really serious.
									<br>
									The teams have used this ‘taxonomy’ to create a set of arguments against the common myths about vaccination: for example by giving evidence against the belief that vaccines are not necessary if you live a healthy lifestyle. These arguments will now be used in further work and studies within JITSUVAX.  These include an online game being developed by the Cambridge team which will train people to resist misinformation. They are also creating a website which will allow HCP’s to look up vaccination myths and find the evidence to combat them. 
									<br>
									We’re looking forward to sharing the results from the survey of HCP’s. We’ll also be releasing both the full survey and a shortened version so that other researchers can also use it. The online game, website and other study results will also be shared as our work continues.
